# Contributing
We greatly appreciate your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, 
whether it is to:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose new features
- Become a maintainer

We have a simple to follow [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and we kindly ask you to follow it in all your 
interactions with the project.

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes Happen Through Pull Requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use 
[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

#### Pull request process

1. Ensure any build dependencies are removed before creating the the Pull Request.
2. Update the README.md with details regarding the change.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would 
   represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The Pull Request will be merged in once you have the sign-off of at least one of the maintainer developers.
   
## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that 
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/eMAGTechLabs/annotation-cache-bundle/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
